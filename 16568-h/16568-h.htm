<span class="i2">It's <i>hers</i> now, alone; for at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You drove her to give you good reason,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Divorced her, and so it's all passed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For <i>you</i>, I mean; she has to bear it&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I'm your friend&mdash;but come, hang it, old fellow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I swear you were somewhat to blame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What the deuce do I mean?' Well, I'll tell you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though it's none of my business. Here!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>Just light a cigar, and keep quiet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You <i>started</i> wrong, Charley Leclear.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">'Nor she!'&mdash;well, I know, but she tried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep it dark. You wouldn't let her,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But laughed at her for it. Her pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldn't stand that, you know. Did you ever<br /></span>
<span class="i2">See a spirited girl in your life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who would patiently pose to be pitied<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As a 'patient Griselda'-like wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When her husband neglects her so plainly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As you did?&mdash;although, on the whole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the wife is the culprit, I've noticed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's rather the favorite r&ocirc;le.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So she flirted a little&mdash;in public&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She'd chances enough and to spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, <i>then</i> if you'd only turned jealous&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But you didn't notice nor care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then her sickness came&mdash;even we fellows<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All thought you behaved like a scrub,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">While you spent your time at the club.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">If I'd been in her place myself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Jove, I'd have <i>left</i> you. She didn't,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But told all her woes to Jack Guelph.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a girl's lost all love for her husband,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And is cursed with a masculine friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To confide in, and he is a blackguard,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She isn't far off from the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, I'm through&mdash;of <i>course</i> nobody blamed you<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the end, when you got your divorce&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You were right enough there&mdash;she'd levanted<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With Guelph, and you'd no other course.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What I mean is, if you'd acted squarely,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The row would have never occurred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for <i>you</i> to be doing the tragic,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Strikes me as a little absurd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it stands, you've the best of the bargain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And she's got a good deal the worst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>Leave it there, and&mdash;just touch the bell, will you?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"'In New York!' Yes, I met her this morning.</span><br />
<span class="i2">I knew her in spite of her paint;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Guelph, too, poor fellow, was with her;</span><br />
<span class="i2">I felt really nervous, and faint,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When he bowed to me, looking <i>so</i> pleading&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">I cut him, of course. Wouldn't you?</span><br />
<span class="i0">If I meet him alone, I'll explain it;</span><br />
<span class="i2">But knowing <i>her</i>, what could I do?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Poor fellow! He looks sadly altered&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">I think it a sin, and a shame,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The way he was wrecked by that <i>creature</i>!</span><br />
<span class="i2">I <i>know</i> he was never to blame.</span><br />
<span class="i0">He never suspected. He liked her&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">He'd known her for most of his life&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">And of course, it <i>was</i> quite a temptation</span><br />
<span class="i2">To run off with another man's wife.</span><br />
<span class="i0">At his age, you know&mdash;barely thirty&mdash;</span><br />
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>
<span class="i2">So romantic, and makes such a noise</span><br />
<span class="i0">In one's club&mdash;why, one <i>can't</i> but excuse him,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Now <i>can</i> one, dear? Boys will be boys.</span><br />
<span class="i0">I've known him so long&mdash;why, he'd come here</span><br />
<span class="i2">And talk to me just like a son.</span><br />
<span class="i0">It's my duty&mdash;I feel as a mother&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">To save him; the thing can be done</span><br />
<span class="i0">Very easily. First, I must show him</span><br />
<span class="i2">How grossly the woman deceived</span><br />
<span class="i0">And entrapped him.&mdash;It made such a scandal</span><br />
<span class="i2">You know, that he <i>can't</i> be received</span><br />
<span class="i0">At all, any more, till he drops her&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">He'll certainly not be so mad</span><br />
<span class="i0">As to hold to her still. Oh, I know him</span><br />
<span class="i2">So well&mdash;I'm quite sure he'll be glad</span><br />
<span class="i0">On <i>any</i> excuse, to oblige me</span><br />
<span class="i2">In a matter so trifling indeed.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Then the way will be clear. <i>We'll</i> receive him,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And the rest will soon follow our lead.</span><br />
<span class="i0">We must keep our eyes on him more closely</span><br /><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>
<span class="i2">Hereafter; young men of his wealth</span><br />
<span class="i0">And position are so sorely tempted</span><br />
<span class="i2">To waste time, and fortune, and health</span><br />
<span class="i0">In frivolous pleasures and pastimes,</span><br />
<span class="i2">That there's but one safe-guard in life</span><br />
<span class="i0">For them and their money&mdash;we've seen it&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">A really nice girl for a wife.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Too bad you've no daughter! My Mamie</span><br />
<span class="i2">Had influence with him for good</span><br />
<span class="i0">Before this affair&mdash;when he comes here</span><br />
<span class="i2">She'll meet him, I'm sure, as she should&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">That is, as if nothing had happened&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">And greet him with sisterly joy;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Between us I know we can <i>save</i> him.</span><br />

<span class="i2">I told Ma just how it would be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I might as well have on a wrapper,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For there isn't a soul here to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There! Sue Delaplaine's pew is empty,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I declare if it isn't too bad!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know my suit cost more than hers did,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I wanted to see her look mad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do think that sexton's too stupid&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He's put some one else in our pew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the girl's dress just kills mine completely;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now what am I going to do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The psalter, and Sue isn't here yet!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I don't care, I think it's a sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For people to get late to service,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just to make a great show coming in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>Perhaps she is sick, and can't get here&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She said she'd a headache last night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How mad she'll be after her fussing!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I declare, it would serve her just right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, you've got here at last, my dear, have you?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Well, I don't think you need be so proud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that bonnet, if Virot did make it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's horrid fast-looking and loud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a dress!&mdash;for a girl in her senses<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To go on the street in light blue!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those coat-sleeves&mdash;they wore them last Summer&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Don't doubt, though, that she thinks they're new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mrs. Gray's polonaise was imported&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So dreadful!&mdash;a minister's wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thinking so much about fashion!&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some girl who's gone on the assistant&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Don't doubt it was Bessie Lamont.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">So devout&mdash;I suppose she don't know<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And the ends of her switches all show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a sight Mrs. Ward is this morning!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That woman will kill me some day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her horrible lilacs and crimsons;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why will these old things dress so gay?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there's Jenny Welles with Fred. Tracy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She's engaged to him now&mdash;horrid thing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear me! I'd keep on my glove sometimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I did have a solitaire ring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How can this girl next to me act so&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The way that she turns round and stares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then makes remarks about people;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She'd better be saying her prayers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh dear, what a dreadful long sermon!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He must love to hear himself talk!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it's after twelve now,&mdash;how provoking!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wanted to have a nice walk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>Through at last. Well it isn't so dreadful<br /></span>
<span class="i2">After all, for we don't dine till one;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Want your pipe? it's in the jar&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Well, I thought I'd just send Maud<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Something for a valentine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I ground some verses out<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the softest kind of style,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of love, and that, you know&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bothered me an awful while;<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>Quite a heavy piece of work.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So when I had got them done&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, I thought them much too good<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just to waste that way on one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jack, I told you, didn't I,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All about that black-eyed girl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up in Stratford&mdash;last July&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh! you know; you saw her curl?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, old fellow, she's the one<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That this row is all about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I sent her&mdash;who'd have thought<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Maud would ever find it out&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those same verses, word for word&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hang it, man! you needn't roar&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Splendid joke!" well, so I thought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No, don't think so any more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yesterday, you know it rained,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'd been up late&mdash;at a ball&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didn't know what else to do&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Went up and made Maud a call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>Found some other girl there, too,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They were playing a duet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fred, my cousin, Nelly Deane,"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yes, Jack, there was my brunette;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You should just have seen me, Jack&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, old fellow, please don't laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel bad about it&mdash;fact&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And I really can't stand chaff.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, I tried to talk to Maud,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There was Nell, though, sitting by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every now and then she'd laugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sure I can't imagine why.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maud would read that beastly poem,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nell's eyes said in just one glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Wont I make you pay for this,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I ever get the chance!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some one came and rang the bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just a note for Nell, by post.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jack, I saw my monogram&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'd have rather seen a ghost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>Yes&mdash;her verses&mdash;I suppose<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That her folks had sent them down&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Couldn't get up there, you know&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till she'd left and come to town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nelly looked them quickly through&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Laughed&mdash;by Jove, I thought she'd choke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Maud&mdash;he'll kill me&mdash;dear! oh, dear!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Read that; isn't it a joke?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maud glanced through them&mdash;sank right down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the sofa&mdash;hid her face&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Crying!"&mdash;not much&mdash;laughing, Jack&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Don't think she's a hopeless case.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I just grabbed my hat and left&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Only wish I'd gone before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How they laughed!&mdash;I heard them, Jack&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till I got outside the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, confession's done me good,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I can never win her back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I'll calmly let her slide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pass the ash-cup, will you, Jack.<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
